Features:
  nHYP-smeared staggered eigenvalues
  Arbitrary number of nHYP smearing parameters

Parameters:
  nsmear, alpha_hyp0, alpha_hyp1, alpha_hyp2
    Number of smearings and smearing parameters

  maxIter
    Maximum iterations allowed for Ritz functional minimization, 200--300
    This limit should be rarely reached

  restart
    Ritz functional minimization loses orthogonality and has to be restarted
    This should be a number in the range 10 to 30

  kiters
    The maximum number of Kalkruter iterations
    Each iteration is a Ritz minimization for each eigenvector
    followed by a diagonalization of the resulting matrix

  eig_tol
    See comments in eig.c about the convergence criterion

  error_decr
    Ritz functional minimization stops after the error decreases by this factor
    Kalkreuter suggests 0.3 as the optimum value
    This prevents wasting time minimizing the Ritz functional
    Instead, converge a little for each eigenvector and then move on to the next
    The goal is to achieve uniform convergence for all the eigenvectors
