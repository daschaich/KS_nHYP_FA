Measure plaquettes and links (psibar-U-psi) at even and odd sites in various directions, to be subtracted in offline analysis.
For the links, the number of stochastic sources is read from the input file.
The meas_link() routine also calculates and prints pbp, and can be called by the HMC.
Both the individual measurements as well as their un-normalized averages are printed, for consistency with previous output.
