Measure Wilson flow using Runge--Kutta integration
At specified points in the flow, measure MCRG-blocked observables
Option to save the Wilson-flowed lattice at the end of the calculation

Parameters:
  epsilon
    Runge--Kutta step size, 0.02 should be safe

  tmax
    How far to integrate
    If tmax=0, the program will try to decide when to stop,
    but this has not been carefully tested

  alpha_hyp{0,1,2}
    HYP smearing parameters for the twice-HYP smeared blocking transformation

  num_block, tblock
    The number MCRG-blocked observable measurements to do, at the times
    at which to do them.

Output:
  WFLOW  t  plaq  E  t^2*E  t*d(t^2*E)/dt  12t^2*(3-plaq)  top.charge
  E and the topological charge are calculated from the clover term
  The alternative based on the plaquette should approach t^2*E for t>~1

  Wilson flow time t prepended to MCRG-blocked output
