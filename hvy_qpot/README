Measure time-like Wilson loops with once-HYP-smeared links for the space-like segments, giving better overlap for the extraction of the heavy quark potential.

Always measure planar, time-like Wilson loops (w_loop2.c).
The input parameter "off_axis_flag 1" turns on measurement of off-axis time-like loops with space-like parts along the directions (1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 0) and (1, 1, 1) (and all others related by the lattice symmetry).

We first HYP-smear the links, then perform a gauge transformation to axial gauge.
The gauge transformation code copies the nontrivial timelike link to all timeslices to simplify the Wilson loop measurement code.
(For APE smearing or for iterating smearing, we'd presumably want to go to axial gauge first, then smear only the spatial links.)

DS removed code for some simple glueball operators, which would need to be checked before being used.

The sample input file is rather simple:
+++
prompt 0
nx 4
ny 4
nz 4
nt 4

alpha_hyp0 0.5
alpha_hyp1 0.5
alpha_hyp2 0.4

off_axis_flag 1
reload_serial tests/lat.sample
+++

The output is a bit less simple:
First, (x+1)*(t+1) rectangular Wilson loops are tagged
WILS_LOOP1_1 x t value

Next, the length-(t+1) off-axis loops (assuming that the spatial volumes are cubic L^3) are tagged
WILS_LOOP2_1 v t value
v = 0 to L/2 - 1 are "45 degree" loops, r = (i + j)N, N = 1, 2, 3...
v = L/2 to L/2 + (L/4 - 1) are "sqrt 5" loops, r = (2i + j)N, N = 1, 2, 3...
v = L/2 + L/4 to (L - 1) + L/4 are "111" loops, r = (i + j + k)N, N = 1, 2, 3...

For example, if L = 12, then L/2 - 1 = 5 and L/4 - 1 = 2, so
0 to 5 are (1, 1) to (6, 6) loops
6, 7 and 8 are (2, 1), (4, 2) and (6, 3) loops
9 to 14 are (1, 1, 1) to (6, 6, 6) loops

Fitting done in a separate directory with a nest of shell scripts.
