Measure Wilson and Polyakov loops after repeated two-HYP blocking steps.
The total number of blocking steps is determined by the smallest side of the lattice.
The input file must specify the number of outer HYP smearing parameters to use ("num_alpha"), as well as their values ("alpha_mcrg").
The specialized block_nhyp_mcrg(num, block) routine handles "neighboring" sites separated by 2^block links.

Sample input file:
+++
prompt 0
nx 4
ny 4
nz 4
nt 4

alpha_hyp1 0.2    # Fixed inner smearing parameters
alpha_hyp2 0.2

num_alpha 5       # Number of outer smearing parameters
alpha_mcrg 0.50   # Values of outer smearing parameters
alpha_mcrg 0.55   # (Must be exactly num_alpha of them!)
alpha_mcrg 0.60
alpha_mcrg 0.65
alpha_mcrg 0.70
