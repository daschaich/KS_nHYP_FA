Measure Wilson or Symanzik flow using Runge--Kutta integration
Can specify points in the flow at which to measure MCRG-blocked observables
Can allow code to increase step size up to max_eps for large t > 5
Option to save the Wilson-flowed lattice at the end of the calculation

Parameters:
  flow choice: 'wilson' or 'symanzik'

  epsilon (initialized to start_eps)
    Runge--Kutta step size, 0.02 should be safe
    For t>5 code can choose larger safe values based on Delta_plaq

  tmax
    How far to integrate

  alpha_hyp{0,1,2}
    HYP smearing parameters for the twice-HYP smeared blocking transformation

  num_block, tblock
    The number MCRG-blocked observable measurements to do, and the times
    at which to do them.

Output:
  [WS]FLOW  t  plaq  E  t^2*E  t*d(t^2*E)/dt  12t^2*(3-plaq)  top.charge  t^2*E_ss  t^2*E_st
  E and the topological charge are calculated from the clover term
  The alternative based on the plaquette should approach t^2*E for t>~1

  Flow time t prepended to MCRG-blocked output
