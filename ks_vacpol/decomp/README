This subdirectory contains two serial utilities, KSdecomp (dating from around
2010) and KSdecay (adapted from KSdecomp in June 2015).

Both of these utilities load (vector and axial-vector) position-space vacuum
polarization tensors Pi^{mu nu}(x) from disk.  The vector (axial-vector) data
file name is assumed to start with "KSvec" ("KSaxi").

KSdecomp uses FFTW (in serial!) to transform the data to momentum space, and
decompose Pi^{mu nu}(Q) into transverse Pi(Q^2) and longitudinal Pi_L(Q^2).  It
prints the transverse and longitudinal parts of the vector, axial-vector, and
V-A correlators, including imaginary parts that should vanish to machine
precision.  (It would be better simply to print out a warning if these didn't
vanish, but backwards compatibility suggests sticking with what we got.)

KSdecay prints out the zero-momentum-project correlation functions, from which
the decay constants FV and FA may be extracted without renormalization factors.

The Makefile is currently customized for Livermore.  It links against LAPACK
and FFTW by default, which can be stripped when compiling KSdecay.
