Measure eigenvalues on RG-blocked lattice, which can optionally be saved

Right now, two HYP smearings are hard-coded in the blocking transformation
An arbitrary number (including zero) can be done after the blocking, with a different set of smearing parameters
Before blocking and smearing, we run the Wilson flow until time tmax
We keep the general block_nhyp_mcrg(num, block) routine even though num=0 and block=1 are fixed
